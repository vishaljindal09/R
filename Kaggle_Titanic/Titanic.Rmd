This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r Read Dataset}
TrainTitanic=read.csv("F:\\Kaggle\\Titanic\\train.csv", header=TRUE,na.strings=c(""," ","NA"))

```

```{r Structure of Data Set}
str(TrainTitanic)
```

```{r Converting to factor}
TrainTitanic$Survived=as.factor(TrainTitanic$Survived)
TrainTitanic$Pclass =as.factor(TrainTitanic$Pclass)
```

```{r cheking summary }
summary(TrainTitanic)
```

```{r cheking NA, include=FALSE}
colSums(is.na(TrainTitanic))
```
```{r Imputing mean for age for approximation as of now}
TrainTitanic$Age[is.na(TrainTitanic$Age)] = mean(TrainTitanic$Age, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```{r Fare plot with survival}
ggplot(TrainTitanic, aes(x=Age,fill=factor(Survived))) + 
  geom_histogram(breaks=seq(0,80,by=4),colour='black') + 
  xlab("Age") + ylab("Passengers")
```
Younger passengers around 12 and older one seems to be rescued compare to rest of the passengers

```{r Sex with survival}
ggplot(TrainTitanic, aes(x = Survived, fill = Sex)) + geom_bar()
```
Females more likely to survive, women and children first it seems from both the plots above

```{r Fare with survival}
ggplot(TrainTitanic, aes(x=Fare,fill=factor(Survived))) + 
  geom_histogram(breaks=seq(0,550,by=10),colour='black') + 
  xlab("Fare") + ylab("Passengers")
```
Expensive ticket holder more likely to survive based on status,hence Class and fare should co-relate as per the last plot

```{r class and Fare}
Fare_mean_Pclass=aggregate(TrainTitanic$Fare, list(TrainTitanic$Pclass), mean)
colnames(Fare_mean_Pclass) <- c("pclass", "mean")
ggplot(Fare_mean_Pclass, aes(x = pclass, y=mean)) +geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

```{r age,fare and survival}
plot(TrainTitanic$Age, TrainTitanic$Fare, pch = 9, col = c('red', 'green')[TrainTitanic$Survived])
```
Red zone shows age 18-50 and lower class(fare)

```{r Embarked}
ggplot(TrainTitanic, aes(x = Survived, fill = Embarked)) + geom_bar()
```
Most survivals are from S(Southampton)
